# Task Management Platform API (TODO App) üöÄ

## Description üìù

This is a minimal backend API for a task management platform (TODO app).
It provides features to create, update, delete, and retrieve tasks, while supporting status filters ("in progress" or "completed").
The app uses Node.js for the backend, SQLite for the database, and Docker for containerization.

## Purpose üéØ

The backend serves as the core API for managing tasks in a to-do list application.
It allows users to perform CRUD operations on tasks and filter them based on their status.
The API is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run in any environment.

## Project Structure üìÇ

The project is organized into several directories to separate concerns and maintain code clarity:

- **`controllers/`**: Contains logic for handling task-related requests.
- **`database/`**: Manages database connection and configuration.
- **`middleware/`**: Defines error handling and custom error messages.
- **`models/`**: Contains Sequelize models for interacting with the database.
- **`routes/`**: Defines the application's HTTP routes.
- **`app.js`**: The main entry point of the application.
- **`taskmngr.db`**: The SQLite database file used to store task data.

## How It Works üîç

### Core Functionalities:
- **Create a task**: Allows users to create a new task with a text and status ("in progress" or "completed").
- **Update a task**: Users can update the status of an existing task.
- **Delete a task**: Tasks can be deleted from the database.
- **Retrieve tasks**: List of tasks can be filtered based on their status or retrieved in full.

### Database:
- The backend uses SQLite as the database to store task data in the `taskmngr.db` file.
- The `models/Task` defines the schema for tasks.
- The `database/dbConnect.js` handles the connection to the SQLite database using Sequelize.

### Error Handling:
- Custom errors are managed using the `middleware/ApiError.js` and `middleware/errorHandling/errorHandler.js`.
- Errors are thrown for invalid operations, such as invalid task status or missing task data.

### Docker Setup:
- The backend is containerized using Docker. The Dockerfile ensures that the app runs smoothly within a container using the `docker run` command.
